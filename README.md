### Purpose ~ 🤡🤡

This App is for creating a react notes for recalling what I have learnt before.

### The major CD tool is: github action workflow + aws s3 bucket

```
- create `.github/workflows/main.yaml` file
- create IAM user and grant S3 full access
- create S3 bucket
- go to github settings & setup the secrets (access key, secret key and bucket name)
- write down all the steps you want your pipeline to run
- create a commit and open a PR and check your github actions (Ship & Go 🚀🚀)
```
